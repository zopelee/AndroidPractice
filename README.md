===================
"FunLibrary" is an Android game framework (like an improved version of the one in Mario Zechner's book).

The game "FunPig" is built based on "FunLibrary".

If you import those projects into Eclipse, 

Please make sure "FunLibrary"->Properties->Android->[checked]Is Library & Reference to "appcompat_v7",

"FunPig"->Properties->Android->[UN-checked]Is Iibrary & Reference to "FunLibrary".

Good day!
